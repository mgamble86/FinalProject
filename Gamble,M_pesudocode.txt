#this code will import fish abundance data, separate it by species, time and age group, then export the data to a .csv file in order to be analyzed and graphed using R

#import fish data
	# Fish = stored fish abundance data in simple text
	
#separate data by species
	# emordax = northern anchovy data
	# ssagax = sardine data
	# fish3 = additional species data (dependent upon avalability)
	
#separate species data by month/year
	# emordax1 = Jan anchovy data, emordax2 = Feb anchovy data, etc...
	# ssagax1 = Jan sardine data, ssagax2 = Feb sardine data, etc...
	# fish31 = Jan species3 data, fish32 = Feb species 3 data, etc...
	
#separate species data by age group
	# em1lar = larval anchovy data for Jan, (repeat for all 12 months)
	# ss1lar = larval sardine data for Jan, (repeat for all 12 months)
	# f31lar = larval species3 data for Jan, (repeat for all 12 months)
#this data can be used independently to analyze population recruitment and in combination with 	
	sea lion blubber/disease data
	
#def ageclass = all species data combined into age class groups
	#this data can be used to compare sea lion data with overall food abundance availability

#def ageclassEN/ageclassLN = age class events data specific to El Nino or La Nina

# data.csv = table of all pruned and sorted fish abundance data exported into .csv format for analysis

# compare fish abundance data and sea lion data in order to look for correlations using R analysis
