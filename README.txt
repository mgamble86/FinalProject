#Final Project EEB 234

#This project will be used to import fish abundance data, sperate it by species, date and age class, then export the data into a .csv format in order to be analyzed sea lion data (blubber, disease, etc...), and possibly weather anomoly data.

#This project currently consists of only pseudocode.
