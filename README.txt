#Final Project EEB 234

#Code to webscrape DNA sequence and species names for Caligus genus from NCBI
    #Code to strip exess characters from name and DNA text.
    #This will likely involve some regex commands

#Align all DNA sequences for comparison

#Code to analyze differences between DNA and format into tree data

#export tree data so it can be analyzed in R or other program to construct
#phylogentic tree of Caligus genus.

#code for R or other program to build tree from data

#Tree will be used to compare geographic distribution of Caligus genus with 
#phylogenetic tree of the genus
